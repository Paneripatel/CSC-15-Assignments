# CSC-15-Assignments

CSC 15 been my initial programming class, I did some small assignments like date input assignment where users can enter dates and can get to know which day of the week is it and holidays corresponding to that date. Another assignment was the one where I created a net banking account which helps us to get balance, monthly interest, other bank details through account number. Also, I created a print calendar using java which can print the calendar of any year after 1800.
